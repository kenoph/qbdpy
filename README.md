# QBDPY

Experimental cffi-based [QBDI](https://qbdi.quarkslab.com/) bindings.

## Install

```python
git clone git@github.com:thebabush/qbdpy.git
cd qbdpy
pip install .
```

## Example

```sh
qbdpy ./examples/tracer.py /bin/ls
```

## Why?

Because python 3.

Because automatic.

Also, because I never used cffi before and wanted to try it out.

## Credits

Shout-out to the folks at [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/) for creating
[QBDI](https://qbdi.quarkslab.com/).

### Complaints

My brain hates the name `qbdi` and keeps writing `qdbi`.
That led me to waste quite some time when using the tool.
